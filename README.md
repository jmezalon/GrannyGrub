# GrannyGrub

Connecting hungry New Yorker’s to cooking grandmothers in their area.

## Abstract

There’s a plethora of food delivery platforms that cater to restaurant deliveries locally and commercially, thus offering a variety of options for business entities to reach customers.

Yet, there are less than a handful of platforms that provide delivery of home cooked meals by individuals. With GrannyGrub, we plan on solving this problem by connecting hungry New Yorkers to a granny cooked home-cooked meal.

When you aren’t feeling well, feeling homesick, or just have a very specific craving for an authentic dish, GrannyGrub can help by bringing a home cooked meal to your door.

Why home cooked meals?

Home cooked meals provided the user with a variety of unique takes on culturally traditional cuisine. Each dish on grannyGrub is a grandmas' own recipe and her own take on the dish. This will allow for a more diverse and versatile menu in the food delivery market.

## Main Page

On the main page of the app, users can use our interactive map and list to find and browse a grandma that serves what she is looking for. Users can hover on the list items and pinpoint their location on the map, or they can use the map to hover over the pins and see the grandmothers name and cuisine type.

Users can filter based on which cuisines they are craving, as well as filtering based on time, either lunch or dinner, and type of service, pickup or delivery.

## Granny page

Once a user is on the Granny page, they will be presented with the selected grandmas dashboard where they can learn more about the granny. There, they will also be able to browse through all the different dishes that the grandma is currently offering, each of which is her own recipe and take on the dish!

## Checkoutpage

Once a dish is selected, and an order is initiated, the user is taken to the Checkout page. On this page, the user will be presented with their order information, and they will be prompted to either sign-up or checkout as a guest.

Once their information is filled out, they will be then taken to the third party payment system, stripe, where they can pay and complete their order.

## Future Implementations

- Implementing an experience feature where users can book a granny to come to their home and teach them how to cook
