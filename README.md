# GrannyGrub

ABOUT OUR APP:

There’s a plethora of food delivery platforms that cater to restaurant deliveries locally and commercially, thus offering a variety of options for business entities to reach customers.
Yet, there are less than a handful of platforms that provide delivery of home cooked meals by individuals. Currently, the only platform in the NYC market that caters to home cooked meals is Chachi’s, and it falls short in various areas.

With GrannyGrub, we plan on solving this problem by connecting hungry New Yorkers to a home-cooked meal.  
Home cooked meals are a novelty for many, especially in a city like NYC. When you aren’t feeling well, feeling homesick, or just have a very specific craving for an authentic dish, GrannyGrub can help by bringing a home cooked meal to your door.

GrannyGrub  will also benefit cooks, or “grandmas”, by providing them with a platform that gives them the choice to share their personal creations, home cooked meals to go or served on their own dinner tables with other New Yorkers. It will also allow them the opportunity to make some extra money doing what they love.
You might be asking, why home cooked meals?
Well, It provides the user with a variety of unique takes on culturally traditional cuisine since each dish would be that grandmas' own recipe and  her own take on the dish. It will allow for a more diverse and versatile menu.
